# MLB 2018 Statistics Viewer
All the files needed for the html based viewer are in the public directory.
The viewer consists of just html, css and js files, therefore no specific
web server framework is needed to run the application. Just put this static
content in the proper directory for your web server.

Alternatively, a node.js web server is included, which is set to run on port 3000.

## Install dependencies and start node.js web server

> npm install
> node app.js

## Load the web page

> http://localhost:3000/
